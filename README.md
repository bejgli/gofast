# File Sorting Software (fisoso?)

A tool for automatically sorting my downloads (or other) folder currently in development. 
The main idea is a daemon process that can be configured via json, allowing the user to create advanced sorting patterns with regex.

At the moment it's just a rough proof of concept but I'm working on it when I have some time to spare.
